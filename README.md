# Final_capstone_projects
This is a part of the Final Capstone Project of Udemy Complete Python Bootcamp.

The file includes solution to following:

* Find PI to the Nth Digit: Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

* Find e to the Nth Digit: Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

* Fibonacci Sequence: Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

* Prime Factorization: Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.

* Next Prime Number: Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.
