# Final Capstone Projects
This is a part of the Final Capstone Project of Udemy Complete Python Bootcamp.

The Part 1 includes solution to following:

* Find PI to the Nth Digit: Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

* Find e to the Nth Digit: Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

* Fibonacci Sequence: Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

* Prime Factorization: Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.

* Next Prime Number: Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.


The Part 2 includes solution to following:

* Binary to Decimal and Back Converter: Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.

* Credit Card Validator: Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum)

* Factorial Finder: The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1.

* Complex Number Algebra: Show addition, multiplication, negation, and inversion of complex numbers in separate functions. (Subtraction and division operations can be made with pairs of these operations.) Print the results for each operation tested.
